# Cleanup Audit

Date: 2026-06-20

Baseline: `develop` at `3e39e742b501008bf3b8c923846c5743ff27e8d3`

Scope: read-only audit for the first cleanup pass after the small-test release
candidate was sealed. This document records candidates only. No production code,
database migration, rollback, authentication, quota, billing, webhook, task
billing, New API mapping, backup, readiness, or security gate file is deleted in
this branch.

Update: cleanup-01 removed the three low-risk superseded planning documents that
were marked as suggested deletes. Their planning content is now covered by the
final handoff, Final QA, current mainline integration documents, and execution
log.

Update: cleanup-02 removed three pre-integration auth audit documents. The
useful historical note is that the old application had a visual-only login form,
no customer user table, no HttpOnly customer session, no quota ledger, and
global local JSON artifact/job records. The current source of truth is now
documented by `FINAL_HANDOFF.md`, `FINAL_QA_REPORT.md`,
`MAINLINE_INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `AUTH_API_CONTRACT.md`,
`SESSION_FLOW.md`, `SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ADR_APPLICATION_DATABASE.md`,
and `USER_MAPPING_CONTRACT.md`.

## Release Baseline

- Release branch: `release/v0.9-small-test`
- Tag: `v0.9.0-rc1`
- Purpose: small-range testing
- Included: A/B UI and backend integration, image and video generation, account
  auth, quota, orders, and task billing
- Not included: production payment enablement or formal server deployment
- Follow-up: code and file cleanup after this audit is reviewed

## Verification Before Audit

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` | Passed | TypeScript completed without errors. |
| `npm run lint` | Passed | ESLint completed without errors. |
| `npm run build` | Passed | Next build passed; Turbopack still reports the existing trace warning from `next.config.ts` through local upscale code. |
| `node scripts/test-auth-session.mjs` | Passed | 17 tests passed. |
| `node scripts/test-quota-usage.mjs` | Passed | 28 passed, 3 PostgreSQL integration cases skipped without local DB env. |
| `node scripts/test-billing-sandbox.mjs` | Passed | 22 passed, 2 PostgreSQL integration cases skipped without local DB env. |
| `node scripts/test-admin-api.mjs` | Passed | 9 tests passed. |
| `node scripts/test-new-api-bff.mjs` | Passed | 32 tests passed. |
| `npm run test:prompt-optimizer` | Passed | 5 tests passed. |
| `npm run test:security-release` | Passed | 9 tests passed. |
| `node scripts/database/bundle-scan.mjs` | Passed | No server secret marker found in client bundle. |
| `npm run security:release-check` | Passed | npm audit 0; secret scan clear; production payment fail-closed and disabled. |

## Safety Findings

- No tracked `.env`, runtime database, log, `.next`, upload, or JSON runtime
  store was found.
- Local ignored runtime artifacts exist and remain untracked:
  `.env.local`, `.next/`, `.runtime/`, `data/`, `dist/`,
  `infra/new-api/.env`, `node_modules/`, `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, `uploads/`,
  and one local `bp02-job-82151925065.log`.
- Secret pattern scan for private keys, GitHub tokens, AWS access keys, and
  OpenAI-style keys returned no tracked matches.
- Production payment remains disabled and fail-closed.

## False Positives

- `local-user` appears in backend tests as a fixture. It is not a runtime fake
  login or fake account source.
- Historical docs mention fake login, fake quota, or fake model states to record
  earlier defects. They are not current runtime behavior.
- `.env.example` and CI-generated `.env` snippets contain placeholders or masked
  test values. No real secret was detected in tracked files.
- PostgreSQL integration tests skipped locally without `APP_DATABASE_URL`; remote
  database workflows remain the authoritative verification path.

## Suggested Cleanup Order

1. Decide retention policy for visual evidence under `docs/design-references/`.
   Keep one final screenshot set per major surface before deleting older history.
2. Archive or remove superseded planning docs only after confirming final handoff
   documents cover the same operational knowledge.
3. Keep all migrations, recovery scripts, release gates, and backend module tests.
4. Only after the documentation cleanup is merged, consider a separate local
   artifact cleanup for ignored files. Do not mix local artifact deletion with
   tracked code cleanup.

## Candidate Counts

- Suggested delete: 0 grouped documentation candidates after cleanup-01.
- Awaiting confirmation: 13 grouped documentation or local-artifact candidates after cleanup-02.
- Explicitly retained high-risk items: 18 grouped candidates.
