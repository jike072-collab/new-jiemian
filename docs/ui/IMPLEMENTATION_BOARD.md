| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline comparison | Done | Local `HEAD` and `origin/main` were compared. |
| Safety snapshot branch | Done | Current branch is `backup/pre-ui-rebuild-2026-06-17`. |

| Reuse audit | Done | Main reuse candidates are `StudioApp`, `BrandLogo`, `AdminProvidersClient`, and server helpers. |
| Failure log | Done | Historical `/login` and `/admin/providers` blockers are archived in `KNOWN_BASELINE_FAILURES.md`; current verification snapshot passes. |
| Screenshot archive | Done | Curated current-state screenshots were copied into `docs/design-references/current-before-rebuild/`. |
| Secrets scan | Done | Repo scan ran; no committed secret strings were found in the module 1 docs. |
| Verification snapshot | Done | `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and HTTP checks on `/`, `/login`, `/admin/providers` all passed in the current worktree. |

## Follow-up Rules

- Do not move to module 2 before user confirmation.
- Keep every completed checkpoint pushable on its own.

| Item | Status | Notes |

| Module 3 segment 1 | Done | Root cause and recovery plan documented. |
| Module 3 segment 2 | In progress | Implementation matrix added; code repair begins next. |
| Module 3 segment 3 | Not started | Final screenshots and verification still pending. |
| Module 4 | Blocked | Wait for module 3 completion and user confirmation. |
